<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![gui screenshot][product-screenshot]]()

This application provides a neat GUI for toggling between the standard RuneLite client and the Hydra Tech client for
Old School RuneScape. [Hydra Tech](https://osrsplugins.xyz/home) is a third party RuneLite plugin which can get your
account banned for its overpowered RuneLite plugins for Old School RuneScape. In order to minimize time spent in the client
you should only use it while you need your plugins.

It's a pain to constantly rename files and switch between the RuneLite and Hydra clients so you don't get banned for being logged into
a third party client. With this application you can seamlessly switch between the two clients so you can use RuneLite for
day to day playing and Hydra when you need a special plugin for a few hours.

This will help to minimize the amount of time logged into Hydra's client and thus reduce the chance of a ban for logging into a
third party client.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* Go to `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Local\RuneLite`
    * Rename your Hydra JAR file you downloaded to "RuneLite-hydra.jar" and move it into the `\AppData\Local\RuneLite` folder
